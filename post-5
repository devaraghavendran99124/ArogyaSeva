<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a>Yoga</a>&nbsp;is an ancient and complex practice, rooted in Indian philosophy. It began as a spiritual practice but has become popular as a way of promoting physical and mental well-being.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although classical yoga also includes other elements, yoga as practiced in the United States typically emphasizes physical postures&nbsp;<em>(asanas)</em>, breathing techniques&nbsp;<em>(pranayama)</em>, and meditation&nbsp;<em>(dyana).&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are many different yoga styles, ranging from gentle practices to physically demanding ones. Differences in the types of yoga used in research studies may affect study results. This makes it challenging to evaluate research on the health effects of yoga.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yoga and two practices of Chinese origin—<a>tai chi</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a>qi gong</a>—are sometimes called “meditative movement” practices. All three practices include both meditative elements and physical ones.</p>

<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Help people with chronic diseases manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although there’s been a lot of research on the health effects of yoga, many studies have included only small numbers of people and haven’t been of high quality. Therefore, in most instances, we can only say that yoga has shown promise for particular health uses, not that it’s been proven to help.</p>
